# CSE341-Project
This is MicroBook, a mock social media app coded in assembly language. This is an academic project assigned by my respected lab faculties of CSE341(Microprocessor) course in fall 2021 semester. This app has 5 features.

1. Load profile: Displays user name, age and friend count.
2. Update age: Increments age by 5 and displays it.
3. Make friend: Increments friend count by 1 and displays it.
4. Like a celebrity: Displays names of 5 celebrities as option. The user then chooses one as a liked celebrity. A user can only like 3 celebrities at most.
5. Show liked celebrities: Displays liked celebrities.

When a user runs this app, the process of creating a new account begins. At first, it asks the user, "How many characters your name has?". Then, it asks the user to enter his/her name and age. After that, it welcomes the users and shows instructions about how to use this app properly. Finally, the user can use this app by following the instruction as long as s/he wants to and also can exit whenever s/he wants to.
